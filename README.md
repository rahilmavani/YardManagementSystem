# YardManagementSystem
Our team BitShift developed an Yard Management System for Efficient container placement in the Yards. This was a part of HackOut'23
It is a Robust Software to Predict the Out Time of Containers in a ShipYard and Identify Correct places to stack them while reducing the number of steps required to shuffle the containers while removing them. It is all based out of Training Data that contains In and Out time of previousy stored containers.
